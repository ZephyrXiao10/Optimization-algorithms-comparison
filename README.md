# Optimization-algorithms-comparison
A comparison between 4 different optimization quantitative algorithms, containing 1/N, equal weight, mean-variance, and BSP(Binary switch portfolio)

The detail of 4 optimized algorithms could be seen in the file 几种优化方法比较.pdf, which is written in Chinese as a report to my director when I was working in MY capital.

This project contains 4 kinds of files 

source code(.py)

data file(.csv)

result(.png)

report(.pdf)

ALL the algorithms and python scripts were developed by myself.
